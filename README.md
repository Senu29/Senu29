- 👋 Hi, I’m @Senu29 Nice to meet you :)
- 👀 I’m interested in the relationship between Computers and Aircrafts (mainly). Overall, I am interested in how line of simple lines code are able to do more than what we can see.\n I love to share my ideas and collaborate with others ideas then help to bring all the ideas together, so the best idea stands. 
- 🌱 I’m currently majoring in Computer Science in The Pennsylvania State College, University Park, as a Sophomore.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on App Development, Python and SwiftUI Coding, or even Critical Thinking Programs 
- 📫 Anyone need to reach me, please email to senu.ratnayake@gmail.com or find me on Instagram: _Senu29_ or my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/senuda-ratnayake-83493917
