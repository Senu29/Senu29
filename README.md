- 👋 Hi, I’m @Senu29 Nice to meet you :)
- 👀 I’m interested in the relationship between Computers and Aircrafts (mainly). Overall, I am interested in how simple lines code are able to do more than what we can see.I love to share my ideas and collaborate with others ideas then help to bring all the ideas together, so the best idea stands. 
- 🌱 I’m currently majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Entrepreneurship & Innovation- in The Pennsylvania State College, University Park, as a 3rd Third Year.
- The main project I have been working on and collaborating is "MyFridge" : https://github.com/kylegeorge10/myFridge
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on App Development, Python and SwiftUI Coding, or even Critical Thinking Programs 
- 📫 Anyone need to reach me, please email to senu.ratnayake@gmail.com or find me on Instagram: _Senu29_ or my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/senuda-ratnayake-83493917
